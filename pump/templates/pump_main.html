                <h5 class="text-white">
                    The basic design of the pump as we know it today has evolved over <span class="text-primary">thousands</span> of years and involves contributions 
                    from multiple inventors and engineers across various civilizations. Here are some major milestones in 
                    the development of the pump:

                </h5>
                <ol>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        Ancient Egyptians (circa 2000 BCE) – Early Egyptians are believed to have used a primitive water-lifting device 
                        called a "shaduf," which consisted of a long pole balanced on a fulcrum with a bucket at one end. It wasn't a 
                        pump in the modern sense but laid the groundwork for water-lifting technology.
                    </li>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        Archimedes (287-212 BCE) – The Greek mathematician and engineer Archimedes is credited with creating the "Archimedean screw," 
                        one of the earliest pump designs still used today for specific applications. The Archimedean screw is a helical tube that can 
                        move water when rotated, and it remains influential in designing modern pumps.
                    </li>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        Ctesibius (circa 285-222 BCE) – The Greek engineer Ctesibius is known for inventing the "force pump," which used a piston to 
                        move water through a tube, creating one of the earliest reciprocating pumps. The design is a closer ancestor to modern mechanical pumps.
                    </li>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        Medieval Islamic Engineers (8th-13th centuries) – Islamic scholars and engineers made significant advancements in hydraulic and 
                        mechanical engineering, improving upon earlier pump designs and creating more complex systems, especially for agriculture and water 
                        distribution.
                    </li>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        The Industrial Revolution (18th-19th centuries) – The modern pump took shape with the Industrial Revolution, as inventors like 
                        Thomas Savery and James Watt developed steam pumps to dewater mines and supply water to cities. This era marked a major leap forward in
                        pump technology, bringing in piston-driven, centrifugal, and steam-powered pumps.
                    </li>
                    <li class="m-3">
                        Centrifugal Pump – In the late 1600s, Denis Papin, a French-born physicist, made critical contributions to the development of the 
                        centrifugal pump, which was refined in the 19th century with advancements in steam technology and mechanical engineering.
                    </li>
                    <h5 class="m-3">
                        The modern pump industry was truly established during the 19th and 20th centuries, as mass manufacturing and new materials 
                        (like stainless steel) enabled pumps to be used for a wide array of applications.

                    <h5>Water</h5>
                    <p class="mb-0">Water plays a very important role in the global economy. Nearly 70% of the freshwater consumed by humans 
                        is used in agriculture. Fishing in both freshwater and saltwater is a primary source of income in many countries. 
                        Many essential and consumer goods are transported via waterways using ships and boats. Large quantities of water and 
                        steam are used in residential and industrial cooling and heating applications. Water is an excellent solvent for many 
                        minerals and organic substances, making it highly useful for industrial and domestic uses such as cooking and cleaning. 
                        Water, ice, and snow are integral to certain sports and recreational activities, such as swimming, boating, and skiing.
